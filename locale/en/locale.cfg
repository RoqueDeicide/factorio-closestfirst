[mod-setting-description]
italics-closestfirst-search_area_setting=The area that is scanned to find constructable/deconstructable entities. Only distances within this area is calculated, when everything has been built or deconstructed inside this area, use base Factorio method. - A high value may lead to lag
italics-closestfirst-update_rate_setting=Off - stay at current range (if it is currently reduced, it will go back to normal when you remove the roboports from your equipment)\nSlow - update every two seconds\nNormal - update up to once per second\nFast - update up to 2 times per second\nFaster - update up to 6 times per second\nFastest - update up to 30 times per second
italics-closestfirst-limit_area_setting=Limit roboports to this range, useful to avoid construction bots spending energy flying very far away when having many roboports - No performance impact
